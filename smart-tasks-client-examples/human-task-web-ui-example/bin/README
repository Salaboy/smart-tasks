To run this example, an JBPM5 human task server must be up so the client can connect. This client is also prepared to run with activiti human tasks.

************
Instructions
************
To run the example,
1) Ensure there is a JBPM5 Human Task Server up.
2) Run mvn jetty:run in this directory.
3) Go to http://localhost:8080/human-task-web-ui-example/new/ and the home page will appear.
4) Type a user name and submit. It will show the task list.
5) Select one of the tasks and the application will show a page with task input, task output, and actions.
6) Click on the actions until complete the task.

*****************
Run with activiti
*****************
If you also want to run this example with activiti human tasks, you should:
1) Configure the file placed in src/main/resources/activiti.cfg.xml with activiti datasource information.
2) Add the following configuration to the file src/main/resources/uihelper/UIHelper.config.xml:
<activiti:ActivityHumanTaskServiceConfiguration name="Activiti" configurationResource="/some/configuration/resource"/>
3) Make sure activiti datasource is up and has human tasks configured for some user.
4) Start this client and search for some users that are in activiti.
5) It will show the tasks.

*************
Next steps:
- Configure profiles to run different scenarios (with JBPM, with activiti, with some mock, etc)
